# Visual Programming for toio&trade; (beta version)

This aims at serving a visual programming environment for toio&trade;
[here](https://toio.github.io/toio-visual-programming/beta/)
to control a cubic robot, called "Core Cube", by building programming blocks
such as moving forward, getting the current position, turning on its light
and so on.

The visual programming environment supports only Japanese so far.
You can find more information [here](https://toio.io/programming/visual-programming.html) in Japanese.
